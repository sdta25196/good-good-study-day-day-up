We built Typescript for both developers and users alike. We’ve made it easy to create themes that allow for a great number of different designs; fluid or fixed width, with plenty of styling opportunities. The editor is powerful, with intelligent dialogs that pick up CSS styles that you’ve written, along with a graphical table editor and tools that facilitate standards compliant HTML creation. However, the program assumes no knowledge of CSS or HTML and so you can manage a website simply by using the WYSIWYG editor and one of the default themes.
